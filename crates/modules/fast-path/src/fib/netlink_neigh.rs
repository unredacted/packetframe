//! Netlink-backed `NeighborResolver` (Option F, Phase 2).
//!
//! Subscribes to `RTM_NEWNEIGH` / `RTM_DELNEIGH` / `RTM_NEWLINK` /
//! `RTM_DELLINK` multicast via rtnetlink's `new_multicast_connection`,
//! translates kernel neighbor-state into [`NeighEvent`], and exposes a
//! cloneable [`NeighborResolveHandle`] for proactive-resolve requests.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!   1. [`NetlinkNeighborResolver::new`] returns (resolver, events_rx, handle).
//!   2. `run()` (async) opens the multicast-subscribed netlink
//!      connection, spawns the rtnetlink connection task, then drives
//!      a `select!` loop that fans netlink packets → [`NeighEvent`]s.
//!   3. A [`CancellationToken`] shuts the loop down cooperatively.
//!
//! **Proactive resolve is a Phase 3 item.** The handle accepts
//! requests and logs them; the actual `ip neigh add ... nud none`
//! path needs a routing-table lookup first to discover the egress
//! ifindex for a given nexthop IP, which couples this module to
//! `rtnetlink::RouteHandle`. First-packet kernel ARP/ND already
//! triggers resolution on its own, so skipping proactive kicks only
//! adds a single-packet latency — not a correctness concern.
//!
//! No direct BPF-map writes happen here — the
//! [`FibProgrammer`](super::programmer) consumes `NeighEvent` and
//! owns the `NEXTHOPS` seqlock write path.
